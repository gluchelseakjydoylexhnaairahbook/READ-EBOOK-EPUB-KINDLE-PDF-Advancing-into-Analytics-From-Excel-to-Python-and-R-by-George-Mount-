Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R by George Mount Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Data Analyst for Fortune 500 Company
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2021
Review: I have currently only read just over 100+ pages in this book and it has been the most useful 100 pages of information that I have come across. This is saying a lot as someone who is not only a Data Analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Also, I am someone who has completely immersed myself in so many tutorials, books, webinars, classes, articles, etc. in search of the right material to really understand data analytics. George Mount had me sold on this book when hearing him speak on Excel, R, and Python in a way that just makes so much more sense than the common narrative of bashing Excel and putting R and Python in competition with each other. He talks with nuance about how they each have their roles. He understands the real-to-life uses of each of these tools that can help one to see that he knows exactly what he's talking about. This book is not just another book in a vast space of so MANY resources out there (believe me, I know first hand). This book has easily risen to the top of any content that I have been in front of up to this point and I will owe George the greatest thanks when my career really takes off further. I gladly would have paid George my college tuition for this one book instead.

Lastly, if you are in your career as a data analyst, looking to how you can start a career in data analytics, a student at a university. Just save yourself so much heartache and pain. Pick up this book and know that it can have a major ROI as it has done for me.

Thank you, George

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Practical, approachable, entertaining resource to upgrade your data skills
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2022
Review: If you are an analyst working in a competitive organization, looking for ways to differentiate yourself and add value, then it's important to continue to explore and expand your skillset. This book serves this need generously and is quite unique as the author walks the reader through a multi-tool journey from Excel to R to Python, weaving in statistical concepts and a generous heap of syntax along the way. Personally, I am implementing Python in some of my work and this book serves as a helpful ongoing resource. A sequel would be great, perhaps expanding on more use cases and expanded implementation in Python. An exploration of BI tools may be a good fit also, and use case for the integration of Python and BI would be an implementation I would personally benefit from. It is a permanent resident in my career book collection in the meantime.

Review: I am using this book to learn better how to integrate R into Power BI. The author is a true teacher, par excellence. I am also subscribed to Enterprise DNA where I have taken his courses. I really enjoy George Mount's teaching style.

Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2021
Review: Mr. Mount obviously knows his subject matter, but what impressed me most was his ability to convey complex concepts in an accessible way. The book is full of graphs, charts, examples, "tips" and "warnings" that bring light to the topics. The tone is personal, yet to the point. Mr. Mount's objective is not to impress readers with his own considerable knowledge, but to gently guide them to develop their own skill set. After reading the book, I felt as if I'd just had a pleasant conversation with a very good, and very intelligent, friend. Well worth the money. I hope Mr. Mount continues to write.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Mundane at best
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023
Review: I liked the idea that the book tried to sell: Advancing into Analytics.
From Excel to R and Python.
From a beginner to a budding analyst.

I bought into the idea because I too learned that way: from (1) easy Excel to advanced Excel like DAX, M, Power Query, and VBA, and then to (2) Power BI, which led me down the path to (3) R and SQL, and then (4) eventually into the coils of Python. And as someone still on the journey, I dare argue that most of the data analytics‚Äô core concepts and procedures, including data mining, can be learned with Excel. (Good example is ‚ÄúLearn Data Mining Through Excel‚Äù by Hong Zhou or "Business Analytics" by James R. Evans.) Of course, at some point, you need more powerful and specialized tools for specific needs.

Alas, I cannot defend this book because it poses as a book for someone who has zero base, but in fact is a review note for those who‚Äôve already seen the entirety once or twice. And even as a review note, it‚Äôs mundane at best. The book covers a whooping range of topics with such shallowness that at one point the author felt justified in introducing half of introductory inferential statistics (a material that deserves an entire semester‚Äôs worth of learning or a textbook of hundreds of pages) in mere 18 pages, without fully explaining each of the concepts introduced.
